    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Flask-RestEasy is a `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org>`_ extension for
    quickly creating `JSON API <http://www.jsonapi.org>`_ compliant
    REST APIs for models created with `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_
    and integrated using the `Flask-SQLAlchemy extension
    <http://www.pythonhosted.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/>`_.

    It also fully supports Ember.js via its
    `REST Adapter <http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.RESTAdapter.html>`_.

    The JSON API standard is currently under development. The implementation
    of Flask-RestEasy will be updated to align with it as it evolves.
